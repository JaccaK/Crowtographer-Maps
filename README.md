# Crowtographer-Maps
Maps for the Crowtographer Java application

### How to use the maps
Simply make sure the maps.png and maps.atlas file are in the same directory as the Crowtographer JAR file. The program should be able to load the maps from these 2 files and automatically create a mapdata directory.
